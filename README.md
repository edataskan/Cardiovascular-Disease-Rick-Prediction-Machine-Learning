Project: Heart Disease Risk Analysis
This project includes various machine learning models and data analysis methods to analyze
and predict Heart Disease Risk. Below is a description of each file's function and instructions
for use are described.
1. randomforest3.py
Description:
• Predicts heart disease risk using the Random Forest algorithm.
• Data preprocessing includes data balancing and model training with SMOTE.
• It also provides a function that estimates risk based on inputs received from the user.
Usage:
1. To run from the terminal:
python randomforest3.py
2. Follow the instructions provided by the program to make predictions by taking data
from the user.
Requirements
• Python 3.7 or higher
• To install the necessary Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
